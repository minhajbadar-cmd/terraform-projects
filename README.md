# Infrastructure & Experiments Workspace

This repository serves as a **parent workspace** for multiple infrastructure and automation projects that I have explored and tested locally.  
Each subdirectory represents an **independent project**, proof-of-concept, or experiment.

The projects may vary in maturity and purpose (learning, testing, reference implementations).
